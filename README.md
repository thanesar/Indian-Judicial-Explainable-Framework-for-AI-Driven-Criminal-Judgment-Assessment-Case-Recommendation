## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

The primary objectives of IJEF are:

1. To develop an AI-powered system for criminal case recommendation, helping lawyers and judges find relevant precedents, acts, and sections efficiently.  
2. To build an explainable AI framework for criminal judgment assessment, ensuring transparency and reliability in legal decision-making.  
3. To enhance judicial consistency by identifying patterns in past criminal rulings, reducing discrepancies in similar cases.  
4. To improve overall judicial efficiency and access to justice, enabling faster criminal case resolution and informed legal research.
